<p>A great night was had at NLS' annual race night last Saturday 22nd of June. Huge thanks to all who came out and supported the event. Also, big thanks to Christina McKeever and all the staff at Wishingwell, Palmers Green for their support on the night. The big winner on the night was "Rossie Flyer" owned and trained by Mick Gorham! Thanks to Sean for Mc'ing the night, our race commentators Vinny & Paul and to Brian & Colin for running the Tote. Pictures of the evening will soon be available on our website and facebook page. 
</p>

<p>Last week NLS recorded their third league win this season leaving us second in the league table. On a balmy Thursday evening in Greenford we beat St Josephs by 1-09 to 1-04. Although not at our best we held the Joe's to 0-1 in the first half and after they responded strongly after half-time NLS held firm and saw out the game in style. Best on the night  for NLS were O'Meachair, O'Regan & Phelan (Shane Gallagher was not best on the night for once). Scorers were: Collery 1-0, Murphy 0-3, Healy 0-2, Ward 0-2, Anderson & Holden 0-1 each. 
</p>

<p>Massive congratulations from all at the club to our secretary Declan Treanor and his wife Aoife on the recent arrival of the latest addition to the Treanor clan. </p>

<p>No fixtures for NLS this week. Training continues Tuesday and Thursday evenings @ 7.30pm sharp in Donkey Lane. Please see our website for location/directions. <p>

							<p>After a number of false starts this season NLS finally turned in a performance on a balmy evening in Ruislip, switching on the style and beating St Anthony's by 3-14 to 1-06. Overall, it was a commanding performance from NLS and deserved in terms of all of the hard work being put in at training. Notable contributions on the day came from McCafferty, McCarthy, Ward, Gallagher & Collory.  Scorers: Collory (2-05), Murphy (0-3), Ward (0-2), Conroy, Glynn, Galvin & Sweeney (0-1 each). Match report is available on our website (see below) and also on London Gaa website. </p>

							<p>All at NLS extend huge congratulations to the London Senior team who won their first Connaught C'ship match in 36 years last weekend. A fantastic day in Ruislip was made even better by the result - well done to all involved!!
 </p>
 <p>
Great win for NLS reserves last week beating Tara's 1-12 to 0-09. An unbeaten start to the league campaign has delighted the reserve manager!

							<p>A trip to Montrose Park for a Murphy Cup fixture against St Joseph's was the past weekends action for NLS. The game ended a draw with a scoreline of NLS 2-10, St Joes 1-13. It was a much improved performance from NLS since our previous outing and we were unlucky not to get the first win of the season under our belts. St Josephs were a good test at this stage of the season but it's clear that more work and effort is needed from all in the coming weeks. 
</p> 
<p>Away from the pitch NLS golfers brought home the first silverware of the season for the club. Our four man team finished runners-up in the London GAA golf classic over the weekend. 
</p> <p>
There may be another Murphy Cup fixture next weekend. Otherwise training continues Tuesday and Thursday evenings @ 7.30pm sharp in Donkey Lane. Please see our website for location/directions.

							<p>NLS got their 2013 campaign underway with a Murphy Cup fixture v
Harlsden Harps in Greenford last Sunday.  Unfortunately things didn't
go our way and we lost by 1-10 to 0-09. Overall it was a good workout
for NLS, some players made their debut for the club and acquitted
themselves very well & others returning to action from some time out
showed that they still have plenty to offer. Although management were
happy with some aspects of the performance it was clear that there's
still plenty room for improvement. We will have another Murphy Cup
fixture on the weekend of 26/27th of April and after shaking off the
rust this past weekend will be anticipating getting the first win of
the season. Training continues Tuesday and Thursday evenings @ 7.30pm
sharp in Donkey Lane. Please see our website for location/directions. 
NLS are currently actively recruiting new players for the forthcoming
season.
